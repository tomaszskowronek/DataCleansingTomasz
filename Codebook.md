Input Data:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
- Test data - 2947 observations with 561 variables
- Subject test data - 2947 obersations with 1 variable
- Activity test data - 2947 observations with 1 variable
- Train data - 7352 observations with 561 variables
- Subject train data - 7352 observations with 1 variable
- Activity train data - 7352 observations with 1 variable
- Features data - Description of 561 variables used by Test and Train data
- Acitvity Labels data - Description of 6 acitvites used by Activity test and train data

All data is merged together and the following transformations are applied:
- Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted
- The descriptive activity names are used for the activities instead of their IDs
- All variables are appropriately labeled with the descriptive names
- The second tidy data set is created as a copy with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The output SummarizedDataFile.txt text file contains 180 obervations with 88 variables:
